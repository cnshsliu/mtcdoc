# Workflow Template

We design a template, start it, then a workflow instance should run, we call this instance a workflow process. Sometime, we may call them template vs. process, othertime, we may call them template vs workflow, or workflow template vs. workflow process, or workflow template vs. workflow instance. So, we may use diffrent terms under differnt circumstances:

> template = workflow template
> workflow = workflow process = process = workflow instance = instance workflow = instance process
> design workflow = design workflow template = design template
> monitor workflow = monitor workflow process = monitor process

but NEVER:

> workflow = template
