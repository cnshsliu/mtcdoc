Hypeautomation is one top trend on the Gartner Top Strategic Technology Trends for 2022. Hyperautomation Hyperautomation is a business-driven, disciplined approach that organizations use to rapidly identify, vet and automate as many business and IT processes as possible. https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/hyperautomation Metatocome disptachs tasks to human and computer systems, you may use it in a tranditional workflow system way, it provides full-fledged workflow system functionalities. It is actually a modern Hyper-automation platform, it can be used to automate everything in an organizaiton that can be automated. Basic Concept MetatoCome is a PaaS service, developers write their own applications, no matter they are iOS App, Android APP, a H5 application with MatatoCome APIs to start a workflow, check worklist, provide UI for endusers to do their own work, or bridge MetatoCome to their own enterprise applications. MetatoCome is also a SaaS sedrvice, if you don't want to develop your own UI, MetatoCome already has full-fledged user interface for enterprise users use it as a SaaS application. Administrators or authorized workflow designer will design workflow template first, then, everyone in the organizaiton can initiate a workflow process, MetatoCome will dispatch task to either human or any IT system via Restful APIs, then MetatoCome receive and check feedback from human or system, decide how to route the process to next step based on the decision of human or system. These steps will continue until it run to the END node of the workflow template. Quick Start For personal use Individual may use MetatoCome as a personal Get Things Done tool. Steps involved in this scenario are: Register Design workflow Run workflow Check worklist Do tasks For small-team use Small team may use MetatoCome to collaborate with internal team members or external collaborators. A formal orgchart structure with formal position definition is normally unnecessary for a small team. Small team may use flexible Teaming insteadly. Teaming defines role-person mapping. you may define as many flexible team as required. you assign a task to a role in template, when initiate this template into a instance process you also pick a team, then MetatoCome will inteperate the team and resolve which person will be responsible for the task based on the role-person mapping defined in the flexible team. Steps that may be involved in this scenario are: Register your team Invite people to join your team Approve join applications Define flexible team Design workflow Run workflow Collaborating with worklist For organization use An organizaiton normally has formal orgchart defined, people are located in diffrent OU (organizaiton unit) and holding different positions. While flexible teaming is also available for organization users, you may find using RFS (Role Definition String) to locate people in your orgchart is a much more flexible way.

A PDS is composed of one to many PDSP(PDS Parts) delimited with empty characters, a semicolon or a comma. Task always go to workflow process starter if PDS is absent or blank. PDSPs are strings represent a User ID, a Team Participant, a Team, a Peer Query, a Leader Query or a Staff Query. Specific User a User ID PDSP starts with \"@\", like \"@steve\" where steve should have an MTC account as steve@emailDomain, the emailDomain of steve is the same as emailDomain of the current user. Flexible Team A Team Participant PDSP is specified as \"role_name\", a role named \"role_name\" will be used to resolve participants, the role-participants relations are defined in the process-level team specified at current workflow process starting, or in the PDS-level team specified in the current PDS. PDS-level team is used when it exits. last PDS-level team is used when multiple PDS-level teams exist. A Team PDSP is specified as \"T:team_name\". Internal Role Please a script node in the template, write code to specify following role participant, the following works will use these dynamic definition. For example, // read Hyperflow Developer's Guide for details setRoles({ SGT: \"userA@company.com\", DIRECTOR: \"userB@company.com\", }); ret='DEFAULT'; If one following work's PDS is \"SGT\", then this work will be delivered to \"userA@company.com\". If another following work's PDS contains \"DIRECTOR\", then \"DIRECTOR\" will be inteperated to \"userB@company.com\". Peer A Peer Query PDSP starts with \"P:\" followed by one or many positions separated by colon. positions are searched at the current org level of the user. We can say they are positions in the current deparments. Leader A Leader Query PDSP starts with \"L:\" followed by one or many positions separated with colon, positions are searched upwards starting from the current org level all the way to the root level. Dor example, let's say the orgchart is \"Root-BU1-Department1\", and people are: \"Root-Lucas-CEO\", \"BU1-Steve-VP:CFO\", \"Department1-John-Director\", and the current user is \"Department1-Lisa\", then, a \"P:Director\" will be resolved as John, a \"P:Director:VP\" wil be resolved to John and Steve. a \"P:CFO\" will be resolved to Steve. A Postion Query is useful in the approval liking scenarios where some specific positions are normally required to approve something. Query An Staff Query PDSP starts with \"Q:\", which is the most flexible PDSP which can replace Peer or Leader PDSP. A Staff PDSP is defined as '&' separated query parameters, a query parameter is defined as: \"OU_regexp/positions_separated_by_colon\", like ouReg1/pos1:pos2&ouReg2/pos3:pos4 which means, find people who hold position of pos1 in ouReg1, who hold position of pos2 in ouReg1, who hold position of pos3 in ouReg2, and who hold position of pos4 in ouReg2. ouReg1 and ouReg2 are Regexp. Same OU Matching if \"ouReg\" is ommitted in a query parameter, for exmaple: \"/pos1:pos2\", people who in the same department of the current user and hold positions of pos1 and pos2 will be resolved to. The same as what a Peer Query PDSP does. Upwards One Matching To get the first matching people of the specified position searching upwards, use double slash: '//', for example, \"Q:000010000200003//pos\", if there is 'pos' in department '000010000200003', use it, or else, seach 'pos' in department '0000100002', if exist, use it, if not, continually search 'pos' in department '00001', exist? use it, no? search 'root' for 'pos', exist? use it, no? use the process starter as 'pos' participants. Upwards All Matching To get all matching people of the specified position searching upward, use three slash: '///', for example, 'Q:000010000200003///pos', if Sam is 'pos' in '00001000200003' , Steve and Angela are 'pos' in '0000100002', Paul is 'pos' in '00001', Jenny is 'pos' in 'root', then 'Q:000010000200003///pos' will resolve to all of them: Sam, Steve, Angela, Paul and Jenny. All Matching if \"ouReg/\" is ommitted in a query parameter, for example, \"pos1:pos2\", or use \"*\" as ouReg, for example, \"*/pos1:pos2\", people who hold positions of pos1 and pos2 in the whole organization will be resolved to. 'staff' use 'staff' position to query all staff who have no specified positional role. 'all' use 'all' to get all people of an OU, for example, \"Q:DEP2/all\" will get all people in DEP2 and its lower level department Variables You may include variable values in PDS. the format is \"[var_name]\", the [var_name] will be repalced with the value of var_name. For example, if there is a var named \"dep\" which has a value of \"finance\", then PDS \"Q:[dep]/director\" will be replace with \"Q:finance/director\". There are several internal variables are always available, they are: starter: the email of the starter starterCN the name of the starter ou_SOU the OU code of the starter So, \"Q:[ou_SOU]/director\" will always point to \"director\" in starter's own department. Examples: director Resolve to: people who take the role of director in the process-level team. (director) director:facilitator;T:TeamA;teacher:T:TeamB Resolve to: people who take the role of director in the team of TeamB. (director, T:TeamB. TeamA is ignored since TeamB is the last PDS-level team) people who take the role of facilitator in the team of TeamB. (director, T:TeamB) people who take the role of teacher in the team of TeamB.

For example: If you have a variable name 'Interviewee_name\", and the interviewee is \"John\", then the work title with a name of \"Please approve offer letter of [Interviewee_name]\" will be \"Please approve offer letter of John\", Simple. Participant Define task participants with Role Definition String, See PDS page for details Instruction Give some instructions to people who take part in this task You may include HTML tags/Handlebars tempalate or varName in brackets in instruction test. Supported HTML Tags Only following HTML tags are supported: \"b\", \"i\", \"em\", \"strong\", \"a\", \"blockquote\", \"li\", \"ol\", \"ul\", \"br\", \"code\", \"span\", \"sub\", \"sup\", \"table\", \"thead\", \"th\", \"tbody\", \"tr\", \"td\", \"div\", \"p\", \"h1\", \"h2\", \"h3\", \"h4\" Handlebars Handlebars format is used to include process variables. If a previous node has a variable named \"days\", then, {{days.value}} can be included in instruction to embed it's value in instruction. Var in square brackets [var_name] will be replaced with var value. You may also have {{days.title}} {{days.type}} etc. included if required. Variables define variable name, type etc. Name : Variable name should be a valid javascript varialbe name, that means, a variable name should start with an alphabetic, or underscore, followed by one to many alphabetic or underscore or numbers. invalid name will make your workflow fails to run. Variable Type : Variable name with specific prefix also indicates variable types, determing how Metatocome SaaS show it to end-users. \"email_\" : an email type input. \"password_\" : an password type input. \"url_\" : an url type input. \"range_\" : an range type input. \"number_\" : an number type input. \"dt_\" : an datetime type input. \"datetime_\" : an datetime type input. \"date_\" : an date type input. \"time_\" : an time type input. \"color_\" : an color type input. \"search_\" : an search type input. \"select_\" : a select type input. \"sl_\" : a select type input. \"sel_\" : a select type input. \"file_\" : an file type input. \"radio_\" : a radio type input. \"textarea_\" : a textarea type input. \"ta_\" : a textarea type input. \"checkbox_\": a checkbox type input. \"cb_\": a checkbox type input. \"ou_\": an Organization Unit Selector \"usr_\": an user ID type input \"user_\": an user ID type input \"tbl_\": an table type input. any other name : a normal input. OU selector A variable starts with \"ou_\" will provide user a selection box of the current orgchart. The orgchart is configurable by people who have the correspoinding access right, normally, the MTC admin of your organizaiton. An OU selector variable named as \"ou_varname\", it can have opitons like \"top_ou_id;[yes|no]\", the string before ';' is the ouid of the first organizaitonal unit, the string after ';' is used to indicate whether the selection list should include the top item or not. User selector A variable starts with \"usr_\" or \"user_\" provides user with a input box for input and validate user id, MTC keep validating while you are inputting, and give you feedback of the result. File uploader A variable starts with \"file_\" will show the user a file drop area, use can drag a file and drop it onto the drop area to upload a local file to MTC. Later, other users could view it, or download it. Internal Variables Following variables you may use directly without being explicitly defined. starter: the uid of the process starter, starterCN: the Name of the process starter. ou_SOU: the OU code of the process starter, ou_user_XYZ, the OU code of a user_XYZ variable These internal varaibles are aslo available for: Workflow Context variables display, Handlebars in comments input, for example: \"{{starterCN.value}}\" Activity title, for example: \"Activity started by [starterCN]\" Selection Option For a variable named like \"select_\", \"sel_\", \"sl_\", or \"ou_\", options should be delimited by semicolon (;), for example \"option1;option2;option3\"; For \"ou_\" variable, the first option will be used as the top OU id, the second is \"yes\" or \"not\", whether to include the top itself. options can also get from a pre-defined list. A list is defined in a list group. A list has it's own key in a list group. \"R:list_group_name\" to get default items from a list group. \"R:list_group_name:key\" to get items from a list group by key. list can be cascaded To make cascaded list. you may: use T:cascade_list_name, for example, you may have province list \"select_A\" defined as \"R:province_list;T:select_B\", then, you may define select_B as \"R:city_list\", then, once use pick a province from select_A, select_B will get the selected value from select_A, and use it as list key to refresh options for select_B, say, get all cities of the selected city. Table A table allow users to input values with a table row by row, column by column. Table variable name starts with tbl_ Table columns are defined with a string delimited by |, individual column can have prefix to define its type: \"date_\" (for date input), \"dt_\" (for date time input). \"sel_\" (for selection) Options for this selection are given as (OPT1:OPT2:OPT3) column's title can be defined with [title=TITLE], or the variable name without prefix. for example, variable dt_THIS with have a title THIS automatically. default value can be defined with [default=DEFAULT_VALUE], if average value of the column is required, mark it with [avg] if sum value of the column is required, mark it with [sum] get how many days between two date type column, define it with =datediff function. get how many days lasting between two datetime, define it with =lastingdays function.

Formula You may use formula for a variable which we have a value the same as the the result of its formula. Formula is defined in the variable's value field, starts with an \"=\". Formula is Javascript expression. try simple expression is strongly recommanded. Examples: =first_name + \" \" + last_name If first_name varialbe has a value of \"John\", last_name is \"Smith\", then the result should be \"John Smith\". =first_name.substring(1) If first_name is \"John\", the result will be \"ohn\"; Label The label of this vairable. Placeholder the placeholder for input or textarea Break Row add a new line after this variable ID give it an optional ID Required this variable's value must be provided. Visible use PDS to define whom this var should be visiable to About Visible Sometime, some sensitive data might should be kept secret from some participants even they have been involved in the process. For instance, in a interview process, the offered salary may not be able to seen by interviewer, only HR and manager could see it, thus, we may use PDS to make this happend. Inform Press 2 at anytime to use Inform An Inform node is used to send message to people. Operations Click on canvas to place an Inform node Shift-Click on an Inform to open it's properties Drag it to move to another location Recipiants: Who will receive emails, define use PDS Subject and Content: may use simple html or Handlebars to embed process variables Script Press 3 at anytime to use Script Operations Click on canvas to place an Script node Shift-Click on an Script to open it's properties Drag it to move to another location Sync Mode Run script in sync mode Async Mode Run script in async mode, external program callback to MetatoCome later to make it continue. Code Embed any javascript code in this node. Return value ret = RET_VALUE; Return value is used as routing option to decide where to go after this script node. Insert any variable kvar(var_name, var_value, var_label) After that, thsi variable named 'var_name' is available for following process. ** If a varialbe named \"var_name\" exists, it's value will be overwrite with this one. Get value of variable. kvalue(var_name) Set inner Team Dynamically set a team for use later. setRoles({ SGT: \"ab@email.com\", DIRECTOR: \"cd@email.com\", }); For steps after this script, any task assigned to role 'SGT' will go to a person whose email is \"ab@email.com\", any task assigned to role \"DIRECTOR\" will go to a person whose email is \"cd@email.com\" Timer A TIMER node is used to control process running time, the process only run through this node when From Start: how long after the start of the whole process From Now: how long after the invoking of this Timer node(end of previous node). Fix: Specific date and time Sub Process An sub-processs will be invoked to run, and the parent process will continue only when the sub-process has been completed. sub-process's last return value will be taken as the return value from sub-process, parent process will use it to determine where to go after it. An sub-process can also run in standalone mode, therefore, the parent process will not wait for it's completing. AND An AND node will make process wait for completion of all it's precedent nodes. OR Any precedent node is completed, an OR node will be went through, process will navigate to the following nodes of OR. An AND node will make process wait for completion of all it's precedent nodes. Ground A Ground node could have no folloing nodes, means the routing is grounded or sink. Connect Connect two nodes to define a route between them. Click one node, then click another node, a curved line will be drawn between them. Shift-clicking on a connection will bring up the connection property window, simply give the connection a Case Value (a string), the Case Value will be displayed alongside of the connection line. this case value will be used to determine whether or not this route will be taken or not after it's FROM node has been completed. A connection between two nodes has direction, it always point from one node (A) to another (B), means that the workflow should run from task A to task B. A connection can have option, option define the route. for example, there is one connection between A to B, there is another connection between A to C, if we give A to B an option value 1, and give A to C an option value 2, then, if A return 2, the workflow will run to C, B will not be routed to. if A is an activity, the user who do that activity will be presented with option 1 and 2 to decide. if A is a script, you may use \"ret=2\" to return 2 from node A.
