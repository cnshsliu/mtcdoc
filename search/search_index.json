Hypeautomation is one top trend on the Gartner Top Strategic Technology Trends for 2022. Hyperautomation Hyperautomation is a business-driven, disciplined approach that organizations use to rapidly identify, vet and automate as many business and IT processes as possible. https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/hyperautomation Metatocome disptachs tasks to human and computer systems, you may use it in a tranditional workflow system way, it provides full-fledged workflow system functionalities. It is actually a modern Hyper-automation platform, it can be used to automate everything in an organizaiton that can be automated. Basic Concept MetatoCome is a PaaS service, developers write their own applications, no matter they are iOS App, Android APP, a H5 application with MatatoCome APIs to start a workflow, check worklist, provide UI for endusers to do their own work, or bridge MetatoCome to their own enterprise applications. MetatoCome is also a SaaS sedrvice, if you don't want to develop your own UI, MetatoCome already has full-fledged user interface for enterprise users use it as a SaaS application. Administrators or authorized workflow designer will design workflow template first, then, everyone in the organizaiton can initiate a workflow process, MetatoCome will dispatch task to either human or any IT system via Restful APIs, then MetatoCome receive and check feedback from human or system, decide how to route the process to next step based on the decision of human or system.

Steps that may be involved in this scenario are: Register your team Invite people to join your team Approve join applications Define flexible team Design workflow Run workflow Collaborating with worklist For organization use An organizaiton normally has formal orgchart defined, people are located in diffrent OU (organizaiton unit) and holding different positions. While flexible teaming is also available for organization users, you may find using RFS (Role Definition String) to locate people in your orgchart is a much more flexible way.

A PDS is composed of one to many PDSP(PDS Parts) delimited with empty characters, a semicolon or a comma. Task always go to workflow process starter if PDS is absent or blank. PDSPs are strings represent a User ID, a Team Participant, a Team, a Peer Query, a Leader Query or a Staff Query. Specific User a User ID PDSP starts with \"@\", like \"@steve\" where steve should have an MTC account as steve@emailDomain, the emailDomain of steve is the same as emailDomain of the current user. Flexible Team A Team Participant PDSP is specified as \"role_name\", a role named \"role_name\" will be used to resolve participants, the role-participants relations are defined in the process-level team specified at current workflow process starting, or in the PDS-level team specified in the current PDS. PDS-level team is used when it exits. last PDS-level team is used when multiple PDS-level teams exist. A Team PDSP is specified as \"T:team_name\". Internal Role Please a script node in the template, write code to specify following role participant, the following works will use these dynamic definition. For example, // read Hyperflow Developer's Guide for details setRoles({ SGT: \"userA@company.com\", DIRECTOR: \"userB@company.com\", }); ret='DEFAULT'; If one following work's PDS is \"SGT\", then this work will be delivered to \"userA@company.com\". If another following work's PDS contains \"DIRECTOR\", then \"DIRECTOR\" will be inteperated to \"userB@company.com\". Peer A Peer Query PDSP starts with \"P:\" followed by one or many positions separated by colon. positions are searched at the current org level of the user. We can say they are positions in the current deparments. Leader A Leader Query PDSP starts with \"L:\" followed by one or many positions separated with colon, positions are searched upwards starting from the current org level all the way to the root level. Dor example, let's say the orgchart is \"Root-BU1-Department1\", and people are: \"Root-Lucas-CEO\", \"BU1-Steve-VP:CFO\", \"Department1-John-Director\", and the current user is \"Department1-Lisa\", then, a \"P:Director\" will be resolved as John, a \"P:Director:VP\" wil be resolved to John and Steve. a \"P:CFO\" will be resolved to Steve. A Postion Query is useful in the approval liking scenarios where some specific positions are normally required to approve something. Query An Staff Query PDSP starts with \"Q:\", which is the most flexible PDSP which can replace Peer or Leader PDSP. A Staff PDSP is defined as '&' separated query parameters, a query parameter is defined as: \"OU_regexp/positions_separated_by_colon\", like ouReg1/pos1:pos2&ouReg2/pos3:pos4 which means, find people who hold position of pos1 in ouReg1, who hold position of pos2 in ouReg1, who hold position of pos3 in ouReg2, and who hold position of pos4 in ouReg2. ouReg1 and ouReg2 are Regexp. Same OU Matching if \"ouReg\" is ommitted in a query parameter, for exmaple: \"/pos1:pos2\", people who in the same department of the current user and hold positions of pos1 and pos2 will be resolved to. The same as what a Peer Query PDSP does. Upwards One Matching To get the first matching people of the specified position searching upwards, use double slash: '//', for example, \"Q:000010000200003//pos\", if there is 'pos' in department '000010000200003', use it, or else, seach 'pos' in department '0000100002', if exist, use it, if not, continually search 'pos' in department '00001', exist? use it, no? search 'root' for 'pos', exist? use it, no? use the process starter as 'pos' participants. Upwards All Matching To get all matching people of the specified position searching upward, use three slash: '///', for example, 'Q:000010000200003///pos', if Sam is 'pos' in '00001000200003' , Steve and Angela are 'pos' in '0000100002', Paul is 'pos' in '00001', Jenny is 'pos' in 'root', then 'Q:000010000200003///pos' will resolve to all of them: Sam, Steve, Angela, Paul and Jenny. All Matching if \"ouReg/\" is ommitted in a query parameter, for example, \"pos1:pos2\", or use \"*\" as ouReg, for example, \"*/pos1:pos2\", people who hold positions of pos1 and pos2 in the whole organization will be resolved to. 'staff' use 'staff' position to query all staff who have no specified positional role. 'all' use 'all' to get all people of an OU, for example, \"Q:DEP2/all\" will get all people in DEP2 and its lower level department Variables You may include variable values in PDS. the format is \"[var_name]\", the [var_name] will be repalced with the value of var_name. For example, if there is a var named \"dep\" which has a value of \"finance\", then PDS \"Q:[dep]/director\" will be replace with \"Q:finance/director\". There are several internal variables are always available, they are: starter: the email of the starter starterCN the name of the starter ou_SOU the OU code of the starter So, \"Q:[ou_SOU]/director\" will always point to \"director\" in starter's own department. Exclude operator: \"-\" stands for \"exclude operator\", it will exlude matched users. Q:*/all;-Q:G*/all Will query all staffs first, then exlude those staffs in OU which ou_id starts with \"G\" Examples: director Resolve to: people who take the role of director in the process-level team.

No PBO Flexible team role will be resolved to the starter (you, normally) since you don't give it a team. Full Context Start So, to start a full-fledged workflow process, normally, you should provid extra contextual information: PBO PBO means Primary Business Object, it's a URL pointing to any meaningful object within your business context. it could be a Project Plan, a PRD, a UED Design Doc, a Git checkin request, a IT maintainance doc etc. With PBO presents, people normally will understand the process as it is surrounding the PBO, the process is fully dedicated to this PBO, that is what the word \"Primary\" means. When users receive a new work item, the PBO will alwasy be available for them to review. they may discuss it, modify it with the support of other IT tools, when they finish their work, they click \"Done\" in MetatoCome. We simple use URL to present PBO but do not hosting PBO in MetatoCome itself, is trying to make the integeration among MetatoCome and other IT systems much more flexible and secure.

Under Pointer mode, you are able to: select a node or connect by clicking it. open property window of node or connect by shift-clicking it move a node by dragging it. pan canvas by clicking on blank area of canvas then dragging it. Other tools refer to a type of workflow node. Node Type MetatoCome designer support various node types, they are Activity, Inform, Script, Timer, Sub Process, AND, OR, Ground, and Connect. Activity is a task need to be done by human Inform is used to send email to certain people. Script is used to embed Javascript in a running process, you may use to control the routing of the process, call a remote web-services running on another system. Timer is used to pause process for certain time, when you need to execute a task after certain time of a previous task's completion, or when you need to dispatch tasks repeatedly, Timer node is helpful for these. Sub Process is used to embed another workflow, or to start another standalone process. AND is a logic operation node to wait for compeletion of all previous tasks OR is a logic operation node to wait for completion of any previous task Groud is used to sink the execution route running to it without having to point to the END node. Connect is a link between two nodes. Node Properties Nodes of most types have properties, Shift-click on a node to open it's properties window to view or edit them. Clicking on the small arrow icon besides a selected node also bring up properties window. Connection also has it's properties, shift-click on a connection to bring it up. Node ID Every node has it's unique ID which is automatically generated by default. Some time, especially when you need to program process logic with script and need to get the user's decision of a node, you may find reassigning a meaningful ID to a node much helpful. To assign user-defined ID to a node, input new ID in properties window and click on \"Set\" button. You have to click on this button deliberately to make the new ID assigned. At the end of designer menu, there is a checkbox to show/hide node IDs on the canvas. Node specification Activity Press 1 anytime to select Activity An activity is a task need to be done by human. Click on canvas to place an Activity node Shift-Click on an Activity to open it's properties Drag it to move to another location Title Activity (Task) title can include process level variables value by placing variable name in square brackets, like [var_name], [var_name] will be replace with the value of var_name. For example: If you have a variable name \"Interviewee_name\", and the interviewee is \"John\", then the work title with a name of \"Please approve offer letter of [Interviewee_name]\" will be \"Please approve offer letter of John\", Simple. Participant Define task participants with Role Definition String, See PDS page for details Vote If there are more than one participants, you may choose how to decide the final decision among many decisions by selcting VOTE modal. Vote models includes: The last one the decision of the last vote. The most The decision that is made of the most people. The least The decision that is made of the least people. All the same or fail to The same decision ( one and the only one) of all people, if there are more than one decisions, the final decision will be what option specified as \"failto\". More than %, or fail to The decison which has percentage bigger than or equal to certain number. If there is no decision earn that percentage value, the final decision will be what option specified as \"failto\". If any match If any one's decision match the specified option, take it as final decision and finish vote. If no one choose that option, use the decision of the last person as final decision. If any, or else the most If any one's decision match the specified option, take it as final decision and finish vote. If no one choose that option, use the decision the most people chosed. If any, or else the least If any one's decision match the specified option, take it as final decision and finish vote. If no one choose that option, use the decision the least people chosed. If any, then all the same , then the most If any one's decision match the specified option, take it as final decision and finish vote. If no one choose that option, use the decision all people chosed (the one and the only one). If more than one decisions are made by all participant, use the most chosed. If any, or fail to If any one's decision match the specified option, take it as final decision and finish vote. else, use the \"faileto\" option. Transferable Check transferable to make this work to allow task owner to transfer the task to another user. Keep single task in loop When you design a workflow running some loop, for example, we have 7 actions named A,B,C,D,E,F,G respectively, and the routing relationship among them are: A->B->(C,D->E->B), means: A goto B, B goto C and D, D goto E, E goto B. So, the workflow process may run like A->B->C and D, then, while C is running, user pick up D task, the process runs continually to D->E->B->C, you see, there are another C when the previous C is still running. If you check the checkbox of Keep single task in loop, the running previous C will be kept, no new C will be disptachted. IF you uncheck the checkbox, while the running previous C is kept, another new C task will be dispatched. Instruction Give some instructions to people who take part in this task You may include HTML tags/Handlebars tempalate or varName in brackets in instruction test. Supported HTML Tags Only following HTML tags are supported: \"b\", \"i\", \"em\", \"strong\", \"a\", \"blockquote\", \"li\", \"ol\", \"ul\", \"br\", \"code\", \"span\", \"sub\", \"sup\", \"table\", \"thead\", \"th\", \"tbody\", \"tr\", \"td\", \"div\", \"p\", \"h1\", \"h2\", \"h3\", \"h4\" Handlebars Handlebars format is used to include process variables. If a previous node has a variable named \"days\", then, {{days.value}} can be included in instruction to embed it's value in instruction. Var in square brackets [var_name] will be replaced with var value. You may also have {{days.title}} {{days.type}} etc. included if required. Variables define variable name, type etc. Name : Variable name should be a valid javascript varialbe name, that means, a variable name should start with an alphabetic, or underscore, followed by one to many alphabetic or underscore or numbers. invalid name will make your workflow fails to run. Type : Variable name with specific prefix also indicates variable types, determing how Metatocome SaaS show it to end-users. Prefix \"email_\" : an email type input. \"password_\" : an password type input. \"url_\" : an url type input. \"range_\" : an range type input. \"number_\" : an number type input. \"dt_\" : an datetime type input. \"datetime_\" : an datetime type input. \"date_\" : an date type input. \"time_\" : an time type input. \"color_\" : an color type input. \"search_\" : an search type input. \"select_\" : a select type input. \"sl_\" : a select type input. \"sel_\" : a select type input. \"file_\" : an file type input. \"radio_\" : a radio type input. \"textarea_\" : a textarea type input. \"ta_\" : a textarea type input. \"checkbox_\": a checkbox type input. \"cb_\": a checkbox type input. \"ou_\": an Organization Unit Selector \"usr_\": an user ID type input \"user_\": an user ID type input \"tbl_\": an table type input. any other name : a normal input. OU selector A variable starts with \"ou_\" will provide user a selection box of the current orgchart. The orgchart is configurable by people who have the correspoinding access right, normally, the MTC admin of your organizaiton. An OU selector variable named as \"ou_varname\", it can have opitons like \"top_ou_id;[yes|no]\", the string before ';' is the ouid of the first organizaitonal unit, the string after ';' is used to indicate whether the selection list should include the top item or not. User selector A variable starts with \"usr_\" or \"user_\" provides user with a input box for input and validate user id, MTC keep validating while you are inputting, and give you feedback of the result. File uploader A variable starts with \"file_\" will show the user a file drop area, use can drag a file and drop it onto the drop area to upload a local file to MTC. Later, other users could view it, or download it. Internal Variables Following variables you may use directly without being explicitly defined. Process level variables: starter : the uid of the process starter, starterCN : the Name of the process starter. ou_SOU : the OU code of the process starter, ou_user_XYZ : the OU code of a user_XYZ variable System variables: $$isoWeek : No. of week in year (number) $$isoWeeksInISOWeekYear : How many weeks in this year $$isoWeekYear : Year (based on full week) $$isoWeekDesc : Description of isoWeek such as W1, W13... $$isoWeekDescFull : Full description, like W1/52-2022 $$date : Full description, like W1/52-2022 These internal varaibles are aslo available for: Workflow Context variables display, Handlebars in comments input, for example: \"{{starterCN.value}}\" Activity title, for example: \"Activity started by [starterCN]\" Template names Selection Option For a variable named like \"select_\", \"sel_\", \"sl_\", or \"ou_\", options should be delimited by semicolon (;), for example \"option1;option2;option3\"; For \"ou_\" variable, the first option will be used as the top OU id, the second is \"yes\" or \"not\", whether to include the top itself. options can also get from a pre-defined list. A list is defined in a list group. A list has it's own key in a list group. \"R:list_group_name\" to get default items from a list group. \"R:list_group_name:key\" to get items from a list group by key. list can be cascaded To make cascaded list. you may: use T:cascade_list_name, for example, you may have province list \"select_A\" defined as \"R:province_list;T:select_B\", then, you may define select_B as \"R:city_list\", then, once use pick a province from select_A, select_B will get the selected value from select_A, and use it as list key to refresh options for select_B, say, get all cities of the selected city.

Table variable name starts with tbl_ Table columns are defined with a string delimited by |, individual column can have prefix to define its type: \"date_\" (for date input), \"dt_\" (for date time input). \"sel_\" (for selection) Options for this selection are given as (OPT1:OPT2:OPT3) column's title can be defined with [title=TITLE], or the variable name without prefix. for example, variable dt_THIS with have a title THIS automatically. default value can be defined with [default=DEFAULT_VALUE], if average value of the column is required, mark it with [avg] if sum value of the column is required, mark it with [sum] get how many days between two date type column, define it with =datediff function. get how many days lasting between two datetime, define it with =lastingdays function. # Example: date\\_\u5f00\u59cb\u65f6\u95f4[title=\u5f00\u59cb\u65e5\u671f]|date\\_\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\u95f4|\u4ece\u54ea\u91cc[default=\u673a\u573a]|\u5230\u54ea\u91cc[default=\u516c\u53f8]|sel\\_\u51fa\u884c\u65b9\u5f0f(\u98de\u673a:\u9ad8\u94c1:\u957f\u9014\u6c7d\u8f66:\u51fa\u79df\u8f66)[default=\u9ad8\u94c1]|=datediff(date\\_\u5f00\u59cb\u65f6\u95f4,date\\_\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\u95f4)+1[title=\u51fa\u5dee\u5929\u6570(\u5929)][default=0][avg]|dt\\_\u5f00\u59cb\u65f6\u70b9|dt\\_\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\u70b9|=lastingdays(dt\\_\u5f00\u59cb\u65f6\u70b9,dt\\_\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\u70b9,0.5)[title=\u8bf7\u5047\u5929\u6570][default=0][sum]|number\\_\u62a5\u9500\u91d1\u989d[sum][avg] The table above has following columns: \u5f00\u59cb\u65f6\u95f4\uff1a \u7c7b\u578b\uff1a\u65e5\u671f Title: \u5f00\u59cb\u65e5\u671f \u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\u95f4 \u7c7b\u578b\uff1a\u65e5\u671f Title: \u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\u95f4 \u4ece\u54ea\u91cc \u7f3a\u7701\u503c\uff1a\u673a\u573a \u5230\u54ea\u91cc \u7f3a\u7701\u503c\uff1a\u516c\u53f8 \u51fa\u884c\u65b9\u5f0f \u7c7b\u578b\uff1a\u9009\u62e9\u5217\u8868 \u53ef\u9009\u9879\uff1a\u98de\u673a\uff0c\u9ad8\u94c1\uff0c\u957f\u9014\u6c7d\u8f66\uff0c\u51fa\u79df\u8f66 \u7f3a\u7701\u503c\uff1a\u9ad8\u94c1 \u51fa\u5dee\u5929\u6570\uff08\u5929\uff09 \u7c7b\u578b\uff1a\u516c\u5f0f \u503c\uff1a\u5f00\u59cb\u65e5\u671f\uff0c\u4e0e\u7ed3\u675f\u65e5\u671f\u7684\u5929\u6570\u5dee\u522b+1\uff0c\u5982\u4e3a\u540c\u4e00\u5929\uff0c\u5219\u503c\u4e3a 1. \u7f3a\u7701\u503c\uff1a0 \u8ba1\u7b97\u5e73\u5747\u503c \u5f00\u59cb\u65f6\u70b9 \u7c7b\u578b\uff1adatetime \u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\u70b9 \u7c7b\u578b\uff1adatetime \u8bf7\u5047\u5929\u6570 \u7c7b\u578b\uff1a\u516c\u5f0f \u503c\uff1a\u5f00\u59cb\u65f6\u70b9\uff0c\u4e0e\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\u70b9\u7684\u5dee\u522b\uff0c\u89c4\u6574\u5230 0.5 \u5929 \u7f3a\u7701\u503c\uff1a0 \u8ba1\u7b97\u603b\u548c \u62a5\u9500\u91d1\u989d \u7c7b\u578b\uff1a\u6570\u5b57 \u6c42\u603b \u6c42\u5e73\u5747 Value the default value of this input. for normal input, the default value will be set in the input box. for select/checkbox/radio, the default value will be selected. Formula You may use formula for a variable which we have a value the same as the the result of its formula. Formula is defined in the variable's value field, starts with an \"=\". Formula is Javascript expression. try simple expression is strongly recommanded. Examples: =first_name + \" \" + last_name If first_name varialbe has a value of \"John\", last_name is \"Smith\", then the result should be \"John Smith\". =first_name.substring(1) If first_name is \"John\", the result will be \"ohn\"; Label The label of this vairable. Placeholder the placeholder for input or textarea Break Row add a new line after this variable ID give it an optional ID Required this variable's value must be provided. Visible use PDS to define whom this var should be visiable to Note: Sometime, some sensitive data might should be kept secret from some participants even they have been involved in the process. For instance, in a interview process, the offered salary may not be able to seen by interviewer, only HR and manager could see it, thus, we may use PDS to make this happend. When use \"when expression\" to control when a variable is availabe for inputting. When expression is a logical expression to compare values of a RV(reference variable) and a GV(given value), it's grammer is: RV[=|==|===|>|>=|<|<=|!=]GV let's say we have: A checkbox named \"checkbox_req\". We want inputbox of \"reason\" to appear only when \"checkbox_req\" is checked. then we could define \"when expression\" for \"reason\" as: checkbox_req=true A kvar named \"number_amount\", and we want another kvar named \"upper_price\" to appear only when \"number_amount\" has a value bigger than 100, then we could define \"when expression\" for \"upper_price\" as: number_amount>100 GV is automatically converted to the type of RV, at this momnent, only string, number, boolean is supported. it's unnecessary to quote with '\"' if it's a string unless it's an empty value. for example, to compare a value is equal to string \"string\", we simple define kvar=string if we need to check whether another kvar has value instead of being blank (user does not key in anything in it's input box), we should use kvar!='' Note: On client side, \"when expression\" is only triggered after the focus leave the correspoinding input of RV. Inform Press 2 at anytime to use Inform An Inform node is used to send message to people. Operations Click on canvas to place an Inform node Shift-Click on an Inform to open it's properties Drag it to move to another location Recipiants: Who will receive emails, define use PDS Subject and Content: may use simple html or Handlebars to embed process variables Script Press 3 at anytime to use Script Operations Click on canvas to place an Script node Shift-Click on an Script to open it's properties Drag it to move to another location Sync Mode Run script in sync mode Async Mode Run script in async mode, external program callback to MetatoCome later to make it continue. Callback Point in async mode, you need to let the CBPid (Callback Point ID) for later calling back. you may post this CBPid to your server like this: MtcSendCallbackPointId=function(url, extraPayload); For example: MtcSendCallbackPointId(\"http://demo.mycompany.com/remembercbpid\", {\"foo\":\"bar\"}); that will call your own API endpoint at \"http://demo.mycompany.com/remembercbpid\", This API endpoint will receive payload: { \"cbpid\": \"A RANDOM Callback Point ID\", \"foo\": \"bar\" } Your program need to record the value of \"cbpid\" somewhere. The workflow process will standby from now on until someday/sometime you callback MetaoTocome. Callback to MTC MetatoCome's callback poit is: http://MTC_HOST/workflow/docallback You should callback with payload: { cbpid: \"the cbpid\", decision: \"Your decision on this point\", kvars: {\"foo\",\"bar\"} } \"cbpid\" is what you saved in last step, \"decision\" will be used to determine where to go afterwards, while \"kvars\" is a JSON which content will be embeded into process context. Following steps could read data defined in \"kvars\". Note , your code must login to MTC first, get session key, and invoke callback point with your sessionkey. Note , use MTC SDK is much easier with SDK.callback( { cbpid: \"the cbpid\", decision: \"Your decision on this point\", kvars: {\"foo\",\"bar\"} } ); Code Embed any javascript code in this node. Return value ret = RET_VALUE; Return value is used as routing option to decide where to go after this script node. Notice: you may return multiple string as \"node decisions\" within an array. If the current script node points to three following nodes, the option of each route to them are labled as \"Choice A\", \"Choice B\" and \"Choice C\". If you write code like: ret = [\"Choice A\", \"Choice C\"]; then the respected two nodes out of three will be dispatched after the execution of this script node. Insert any variable MtcSet(var_name, var_value, var_label) After that, thsi variable named 'var_name' is available for following process. ** If a varialbe named \"var_name\" exists, it's value will be overwrite with this one. Get value of variable. MtcGet(var_name) Get value of table. // get table object first let table = MtcGet(\"table_name\") // get table rows, let rows = table.rows // rows is an Javascript Array object, which will contain all rows value of the table // we may then interate rows with normal Javascript operations on an array // columns are also addressable: let v = rows[0][0]; // the 1st column of the 1st row v = rows[0][1]; // the 2nd column of the 1st row v = rows[1][1]; // the 2nd column of the 2nd row Get node decision MtcGetDecision(\"THE_NODE_ID\"); or MtcDecision(\"THE_NODE_ID\"); Set node decision MtcSetDecision(\"THE_NODE_ID\", DECISION); or MtcDecision(\"THE_NODE_ID\", DECISION); Set inner Team Dynamically set a team for use later. setRoles({ SGT: \"ab@email.com\", DIRECTOR: \"cd@email.com\", }); For steps after this script, any task assigned to role 'SGT' will go to a person whose email is \"ab@email.com\", any task assigned to role \"DIRECTOR\" will go to a person whose email is \"cd@email.com\" Script logging You may use normal javascript \"console.log\" to log debug messages in your script code. to view the log, click on 'Show log' on a process details page. Send process context data to your own system MtcSendContext(url) The context data will be packed into a JSON like below and sent to the url { \"context\":{ \"wfid\":\"...\", \"tplid\":\"...\", \"starter\": {...}, \"data1\":{...}, \"data2\": {...} } } Timer A TIMER node is used to control process running time, the process only run through this node when From Start: how long after the start of the whole process From Now: how long after the invoking of this Timer node(end of previous node). Fix: Specific date and time Sub Process An sub-processs will be invoked to run, and the parent process will continue only when the sub-process has been completed. sub-process's last return value will be taken as the return value from sub-process, parent process will use it to determine where to go after it. An sub-process can also run in standalone mode, therefore, the parent process will not wait for it's completing. Note: sub-process running in standalong mode always return \"DEFAULT\" immediately to it's parent, thus, there must be at least one following connection with 'DEFAULT' option to have parent process running as expected, or else, the parent process will stop at invoking this sub-process. Here is an exmaple, take a look at the following process monitoring capture, you could notice the process did not continue after \"Sub\". the reason is that \"Sub\" had been set to \"standalone\" mode and would return \"Default\" always and immediately but there is no \"Default\" route after it. AND An AND node will make process wait for completion of all it's precedent nodes. OR Any precedent node is completed, an OR node will be went through, process will navigate to the following nodes of OR. Ground A Ground node could have no folloing nodes, means the routing is grounded or sink. Connect Connect two nodes to define a route between them. Click one node, then click another node, a curved line will be drawn between them. Shift-clicking on a connection will bring up the connection property window, simply give the connection a Case Value (a string), the Case Value will be displayed alongside of the connection line. this case value will be used to determine whether or not this route will be taken or not after it's FROM node has been completed. A connection between two nodes has direction, it always point from one node (A) to another (B), means that the workflow should run from task A to task B. A connection can have option, option define the route. for example, there is one connection between A to B, there is another connection between A to C, if we give A to B an option value 1, and give A to C an option value 2, then, if A return 2, the workflow will run to C, B will not be routed to. if A is an activity, the user who do that activity will be presented with option 1 and 2 to decide. if A is a script, you may use \"ret=2\" to return 2 from node A. Build a connection Select CONNECT tool , or simple press 9, the CONNECT tool will be highlighted Click on the first node A, Click on the second node B To connect multiple nodes in chain, click on them while holding Alt key. Move a connection Hold Alt key (MAC: Opt), click on the first half of a connection then pick another node to re-select its' staring node Hold Alt key (MAC: Opt), click on the second half of a connection then pick another node to re-select it's ending node or: Mouse over a connection, press \"cb\" to move it's starting point; Mouse over a connection, press \"ce\" to move it's ending point; Cancel connecting If you would like to cancel while connecting, double click on blank area of canvas, or press ESC Delete a connection Mouse over a connection, then press Backspace or Delete Give connection a value Hold Shift key, click on a connection, input is option value in the pop-up. While pointing at a connection, press 'ct' to clear it's value While pointing at a connection, press Ctrl-V to paste a value, after press Ctrl-C on an existing connection. The connection values will be prompted as Buttons to users who are doing the work the connection linked from. User click the button to make his/her decision, the workflow engine use user's decision to determine what's the next step. These buttons are displayed sorted by their labels' alphabetic order, Thus, \"A Choice\" is always displayed before \"B Choice\", and \"1. A Choice\" is always displayed before \"2. A Choice\".

Participant Definition String A PDS(Participant Definition String) is used to resolve who will participate a task. A PDS is composed of one to many PDSP(PDS Parts) delimited with empty characters, a semicolon or a comma. Task always go to workflow process starter if PDS is absent or blank. PDSPs are strings represent a User ID, a Team Participant, a Team, a Peer Query, a Leader Query or a Staff Query. Specific User a User ID PDSP starts with \"@\", like \"@steve\" where steve should have an MTC account as steve@emailDomain, the emailDomain of steve is the same as emailDomain of the current user. Flexible Team A Team Participant PDSP is specified as \"role_name\", a role named \"role_name\" will be used to resolve participants, the role-participants relations are defined in the process-level team specified at current workflow process starting, or in the PDS-level team specified in the current PDS. PDS-level team is used when it exits. last PDS-level team is used when multiple PDS-level teams exist. A Team PDSP is specified as \"T:team_name\". Internal Role Please a script node in the template, write code to specify following role participant, the following works will use these dynamic definition. For example, // read Hyperflow Developer's Guide for details setRoles({ SGT: \"userA@company.com\", DIRECTOR: \"userB@company.com\", }); ret='DEFAULT'; If one following work's PDS is \"SGT\", then this work will be delivered to \"userA@company.com\". If another following work's PDS contains \"DIRECTOR\", then \"DIRECTOR\" will be inteperated to \"userB@company.com\". Peer A Peer Query PDSP starts with \"P:\" followed by one or many positions separated by colon. positions are searched at the current org level of the user. We can say they are positions in the current deparments. Leader A Leader Query PDSP starts with \"L:\" followed by one or many positions separated with colon, positions are searched upwards starting from the current org level all the way to the root level. Dor example, let's say the orgchart is \"Root-BU1-Department1\", and people are: \"Root-Lucas-CEO\", \"BU1-Steve-VP:CFO\", \"Department1-John-Director\", and the current user is \"Department1-Lisa\", then, a \"P:Director\" will be resolved as John, a \"P:Director:VP\" wil be resolved to John and Steve. a \"P:CFO\" will be resolved to Steve. A Postion Query is useful in the approval liking scenarios where some specific positions are normally required to approve something. Query An Staff Query PDSP starts with \"Q:\", which is the most flexible PDSP which can replace Peer or Leader PDSP. A Staff PDSP is defined as '&' separated query parameters, a query parameter is defined as: \"OU_regexp/positions_separated_by_colon\", like ouReg1/pos1:pos2&ouReg2/pos3:pos4 which means, find people who hold position of pos1 in ouReg1, who hold position of pos2 in ouReg1, who hold position of pos3 in ouReg2, and who hold position of pos4 in ouReg2. ouReg1 and ouReg2 are Regexp. Same OU Matching if \"ouReg\" is ommitted in a query parameter, for exmaple: \"/pos1:pos2\", people who in the same department of the current user and hold positions of pos1 and pos2 will be resolved to. The same as what a Peer Query PDSP does. Upwards One Matching To get the first matching people of the specified position searching upwards, use double slash: '//', for example, \"Q:000010000200003//pos\", if there is 'pos' in department '000010000200003', use it, or else, seach 'pos' in department '0000100002', if exist, use it, if not, continually search 'pos' in department '00001', exist? use it, no? search 'root' for 'pos', exist? use it, no? use the process starter as 'pos' participants. Upwards All Matching To get all matching people of the specified position searching upward, use three slash: '///', for example, 'Q:000010000200003///pos', if Sam is 'pos' in '00001000200003' , Steve and Angela are 'pos' in '0000100002', Paul is 'pos' in '00001', Jenny is 'pos' in 'root', then 'Q:000010000200003///pos' will resolve to all of them: Sam, Steve, Angela, Paul and Jenny.

Population is the process of automatically replacing the specified paths in the document with document(s) from other collection(s).

A PDS is composed of one to many PDSP(PDS Parts) delimited with empty characters, a semicolon or a comma. Task always go to workflow process starter if PDS is absent or blank. PDSPs are strings represent a User ID, a Team Role, a Team, a Peer Query, a Leader Query or a Staff Query. a User ID PDSP starts with \"@\", like \"@steve\" where steve should have an MTC account as steve@emailDomain, the emailDomain of steve is the same as emailDomain of the current user. A Team Role PDSP is specified as \"role_name\", a role named \"role_name\" will be used to resolve participants, the role-participants relations are defined in the process-level team specified at current workflow process starting, or in the PDS-level team specified in the current PDS. PDS-level team is used when it exits. last PDS-level team is used when multiple PDS-level teams exist. A Team PDSP is specified as \"T:team_name\". A Peer Query PDSP starts with \"P:\" followed by one or many positions separated by colon. positions are searched at the current org level of the user. We can say they are positions in the current deparments. A Leader Query PDSP starts with \"L:\" followed by one or many positions separated with colon, positions are searched upwards starting from the current org level all the way to the root level. Dor example, let's say the orgchart is \"Root-BU1-Department1\", and people are: \"Root-Lucas-CEO\", \"BU1-Steve-VP:CFO\", \"Department1-John-Director\", and the current user is \"Department1-Lisa\", then, a \"P:Director\" will be resolved as John, a \"P:Director:VP\" wil be resolved to John and Steve. a \"P:CFO\" will be resolved to Steve. A Postion Query is useful in the approval liking scenarios where some specific positions are normally required to approve something. An Staff Query PDSP starts with \"Q:\", which is the most flexible PDSP which can replace Peer or Leader PDSP. A Staff PDSP is defined as '&' separated query parameters, a query parameter is defined as: \"OU_regexp/positions_separated_by_colon\", like ouReg1/pos1:pos2&ouReg2/pos3:pos4 which means, find people who hold position of pos1 in ouReg1, who hold position of pos2 in ouReg1, who hold position of pos3 in ouReg2, and who hold position of pos4 in ouReg2. ouReg1 and ouReg2 are Regexp. if \"ouReg\" is ommitted in a query parameter, for exmaple: \"/pos1:pos2\", people who in the same department of the current user and hold positions of pos1 and pos2 will be resolved to. The same as what a Peer Query PDSP does. if \"ouReg/\" is ommitted in a query parameter, for example, \"pos1:pos2\", people who in the same department or the upper level orgchart of the current user and hold positions of pos1 and pos2 will be resolved to. The same as what a Leader Query PDSP does. So, 'Q:CEO:CTO' and 'L:CEO:CTO' will be resolved to the same people. Exaples: director Resolve to: people who take the role of director in the process-level team. (director) director:facilitator;T:TeamA;teacher:T:TeamB Resolve to: people who take the role of director in the team of TeamB. (director, T:TeamB.

A PDS is composed of one to many PDSP(PDS Parts) delimited with empty characters, a semicolon or a comma. Task always go to workflow process starter if PDS is absent or blank. PDSPs are strings represent a User ID, a Team Role, a Team, a Peer Query, a Leader Query or a Staff Query. a User ID PDSP starts with \"@\", like \"@steve\" where steve should have an MTC account as steve@emailDomain, the emailDomain of steve is the same as emailDomain of the current user. A Team Role PDSP is specified as \"role_name\", a role named \"role_name\" will be used to resolve participants, the role-participants relations are defined in the process-level team specified at current workflow process starting, or in the PDS-level team specified in the current PDS. PDS-level team is used when it exits. last PDS-level team is used when multiple PDS-level teams exist. A Team PDSP is specified as \"T:team_name\". A Peer Query PDSP starts with \"P:\" followed by one or many positions separated by colon. positions are searched at the current org level of the user. We can say they are positions in the current deparments. A Leader Query PDSP starts with \"L:\" followed by one or many positions separated with colon, positions are searched upwards starting from the current org level all the way to the root level. Dor example, let's say the orgchart is \"Root-BU1-Department1\", and people are: \"Root-Lucas-CEO\", \"BU1-Steve-VP:CFO\", \"Department1-John-Director\", and the current user is \"Department1-Lisa\", then, a \"P:Director\" will be resolved as John, a \"P:Director:VP\" wil be resolved to John and Steve. a \"P:CFO\" will be resolved to Steve. A Postion Query is useful in the approval liking scenarios where some specific positions are normally required to approve something. An Staff Query PDSP starts with \"Q:\", which is the most flexible PDSP which can replace Peer or Leader PDSP. A Staff PDSP is defined as '&' separated query parameters, a query parameter is defined as: \"OU_regexp/positions_separated_by_colon\", like ouReg1/pos1:pos2&ouReg2/pos3:pos4 which means, find people who hold position of pos1 in ouReg1, who hold position of pos2 in ouReg1, who hold position of pos3 in ouReg2, and who hold position of pos4 in ouReg2. ouReg1 and ouReg2 are Regexp. if \"ouReg\" is ommitted in a query parameter, for exmaple: \"/pos1:pos2\", people who in the same department of the current user and hold positions of pos1 and pos2 will be resolved to. The same as what a Peer Query PDSP does. if \"ouReg/\" is ommitted in a query parameter, for example, \"pos1:pos2\", people who in the same department or the upper level orgchart of the current user and hold positions of pos1 and pos2 will be resolved to. The same as what a Leader Query PDSP does. So, 'Q:CEO:CTO' and 'L:CEO:CTO' will be resolved to the same people.","title":"PDS: Role Definition String"},{"location":"zh_CN/setting/personal.html#exaples","text":"director Resolve to: people who take the role of director in the process-level team.

used to include process variables. If a previous node has a variable named \"days\", then, {{days.value}} can be included in instruction to embed it's value in instruction. Var in square brackets [var_name] will be replaced with var value. You may also have {{days.title}} {{days.type}} etc. included if required. Variables define variable name, type etc. Name : Variable name should be a valid javascript varialbe name, that means, a variable name should start with an alphabetic, or underscore, followed by one to many alphabetic or underscore or numbers. invalid name will make your workflow fails to run. Variable Type : Variable name with specific prefix also indicates variable types, determing how Metatocome SaaS show it to end-users. \"email_\" : an email type input. \"password_\" : an password type input. \"url_\" : an url type input. \"range_\" : an range type input. \"number_\" : an number type input. \"dt_\" : an datetime type input. \"datetime_\" : an datetime type input. \"date_\" : an date type input. \"time_\" : an time type input. \"color_\" : an color type input. \"search_\" : an search type input. \"select_\" : a select type input. \"sl_\" : a select type input. \"sel_\" : a select type input. \"file_\" : an file type input. \"radio_\" : a radio type input. \"textarea_\" : a textarea type input. \"ta_\" : a textarea type input. \"checkbox_\": a checkbox type input. \"cb_\": a checkbox type input. \"ou_\": an Organization Unit Selector \"usr_\": an user ID type input \"user_\": an user ID type input \"tbl_\": an table type input. any other name : a normal input. OU selector A variable starts with \"ou_\" will provide user a selection box of the current orgchart. The orgchart is configurable by people who have the correspoinding access right, normally, the MTC admin of your organizaiton. An OU selector variable named as \"ou_varname\", it can have opitons like \"top_ou_id;[yes|no]\", the string before ';' is the ouid of the first organizaitonal unit, the string after ';' is used to indicate whether the selection list should include the top item or not. User selector A variable starts with \"usr_\" or \"user_\" provides user with a input box for input and validate user id, MTC keep validating while you are inputting, and give you feedback of the result. File uploader A variable starts with \"file_\" will show the user a file drop area, use can drag a file and drop it onto the drop area to upload a local file to MTC. Later, other users could view it, or download it. Internal Variables Following variables you may use directly without being explicitly defined. Process level variables: starter : the uid of the process starter, starterCN : the Name of the process starter. ou_SOU : the OU code of the process starter, ou_user_XYZ : the OU code of a user_XYZ variable System variables: $$isoWeek : No. of week in year (number) $$isoWeeksInISOWeekYear : How many weeks in this year $$isoWeekYear : Year (based on full week) $$isoWeekDesc : Description of isoWeek such as W1, W13... $$isoWeekDescFull : Full description, like W1/52-2022 These internal varaibles are aslo available for: Workflow Context variables display, Handlebars in comments input, for example: \"{{starterCN.value}}\" Activity title, for example: \"Activity started by [starterCN]\" Selection Option For a variable named like \"select_\", \"sel_\", \"sl_\", or \"ou_\", options should be delimited by semicolon (;), for example \"option1;option2;option3\"; For \"ou_\" variable, the first option will be used as the top OU id, the second is \"yes\" or \"not\", whether to include the top itself. options can also get from a pre-defined list. A list is defined in a list group. A list has it's own key in a list group. \"R:list_group_name\" to get default items from a list group. \"R:list_group_name:key\" to get items from a list group by key. list can be cascaded To make cascaded list. you may: use T:cascade_list_name, for example, you may have province list \"select_A\" defined as \"R:province_list;T:select_B\", then, you may define select_B as \"R:city_list\", then, once use pick a province from select_A, select_B will get the selected value from select_A, and use it as list key to refresh options for select_B, say, get all cities of the selected city. Table A table allow users to input values with a table row by row, column by column. Table variable name starts with tbl_ Table columns are defined with a string delimited by |, individual column can have prefix to define its type: \"date_\" (for date input), \"dt_\" (for date time input). \"sel_\" (for selection) Options for this selection are given as (OPT1:OPT2:OPT3) column's title can be defined with [title=TITLE], or the variable name without prefix. for example, variable dt_THIS with have a title THIS automatically. default value can be defined with [default=DEFAULT_VALUE], if average value of the column is required, mark it with [avg] if sum value of the column is required, mark it with [sum] get how many days between two date type column, define it with =datediff function. get how many days lasting between two datetime, define it with =lastingdays function.

Formula You may use formula for a variable which we have a value the same as the the result of its formula. Formula is defined in the variable's value field, starts with an \"=\". Formula is Javascript expression. try simple expression is strongly recommanded. Examples: =first_name + \" \" + last_name If first_name varialbe has a value of \"John\", last_name is \"Smith\", then the result should be \"John Smith\". =first_name.substring(1) If first_name is \"John\", the result will be \"ohn\"; Label The label of this vairable.

Code Embed any javascript code in this node. Return value ret = RET_VALUE; Return value is used as routing option to decide where to go after this script node. Insert any variable kvar(var_name, var_value, var_label) After that, thsi variable named 'var_name' is available for following process. ** If a varialbe named \"var_name\" exists, it's value will be overwrite with this one. Get value of variable. kvalue(var_name) Set inner Team Dynamically set a team for use later. setRoles({ SGT: \"ab@email.com\", DIRECTOR: \"cd@email.com\", }); For steps after this script, any task assigned to role 'SGT' will go to a person whose email is \"ab@email.com\", any task assigned to role \"DIRECTOR\" will go to a person whose email is \"cd@email.com\" Timer A TIMER node is used to control process running time, the process only run through this node when From Start: how long after the start of the whole process From Now: how long after the invoking of this Timer node(end of previous node). Fix: Specific date and time Sub Process An sub-processs will be invoked to run, and the parent process will continue only when the sub-process has been completed. sub-process's last return value will be taken as the return value from sub-process, parent process will use it to determine where to go after it. An sub-process can also run in standalone mode, therefore, the parent process will not wait for it's completing. AND An AND node will make process wait for completion of all it's precedent nodes. \u5e76\u8282\u70b9\u9700\u8981\u7b49\u5f85\u5176\u524d\u5e8f\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u5168\u90e8\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u624d\u4f1a\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u7eed\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002 \u5982\u679c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5faa\u73af\uff0cAND \u8282\u70b9\u603b\u662f\u80fd\u505a\u5230\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u65b0\u4e00\u8f6e\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002 \u4f8b\u5982\uff0cA \u8282\u70b9\u6307\u5411 B \u548c C \u8282\u70b9\uff0cB \u548c C \u805a\u5408\u5230 AND\uff0c AND \u540e\u662f D\uff0c D \u6307\u5411 END\uff0cD \u4e5f\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u8def\u5f84\u6307\u5411\u5230 A\u3002 \u90a3\u4e48\uff0c\u5f53 BC \u5b8c\u6210\uff0cAND \u901a\u8fc7\uff0cD \u5b8c\u6210\u540e\u6d41\u5411 A\uff0c\u5f00\u59cb\u65b0\u4e00\u8f6e\u3002 \u65b0\u4e00\u8f6e\u4e2d\uff0cB \u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u6b64\u65f6\uff0c\u5373\u4fbf\u4e0a\u4e00\u8f6e\u7684 C \u6709\u5b8c\u6210\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0cAND \u4e5f\u4e0d\u4f1a\u901a\u8fc7\uff0c\u5b83\u4f1a\u7b49\u5f85\u5728\u65b0\u4e00\u8f6e\u4e2d\u7684 C \u5b8c\u6210\u3002 \u6ce8\u610f \u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e9b\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0cAND \u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u4f60\u9884\u671f\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u652f\u4e2d\u7684\u67d0\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u6b8a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6d41\u5411\u4e86\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u652f\u5c31\u6ca1\u6709\u673a\u4f1a\u6d41\u5411\u5230 AND\u3002\u6d41\u7a0b\u5c31\u4f1a\u505c\u5728 AND \u8282\u70b9\u4e0a\u3002 \u6ce8\u610f \u5bf9\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u4f7f\u7528\u811a\u672c\u8282\u70b9\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u5e76\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u3002 \u53c2\u89c1\u811a\u672c\u4e00\u8282 OR \u53ea\u6709\u524d\u9762\u6709\u4e00\u6761\u8def\u5f84\u901a\u8fc7\uff0cOR \u8282\u70b9\u5c31\u4f1a\u88ab\u901a\u8fc7\u3002 \u5176\u5b83\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u4f1a\u88ab\u5ffd\u7565\u3002 \u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u4e0e\u201c\u8854\u63a5\u201d\u8282\u70b9\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u201c\u8854\u63a5\u201d\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u53ea\u662f\u7528\u4e8e\u8854\u63a5\u7ebf\u8def\uff0c\u5bf9\u8fd0\u884c\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4f5c\u63a7\u5236 Ground A Ground node could have no folloing nodes, means the routing is grounded or sink. Connect Connect two nodes to define a route between them. Click one node, then click another node, a curved line will be drawn between them. Shift-clicking on a connection will bring up the connection property window, simply give the connection a Case Value (a string), the Case Value will be displayed alongside of the connection line. this case value will be used to determine whether or not this route will be taken or not after it's FROM node has been completed. A connection between two nodes has direction, it always point from one node (A) to another (B), means that the workflow should run from task A to task B. A connection can have option, option define the route. for example, there is one connection between A to B, there is another connection between A to C, if we give A to B an option value 1, and give A to C an option value 2, then, if A return 2, the workflow will run to C, B will not be routed to. if A is an activity, the user who do that activity will be presented with option 1 and 2 to decide. if A is a script, you may use \"ret=2\" to return 2 from node A.
